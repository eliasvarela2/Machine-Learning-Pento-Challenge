For this project you Will need to use the two following datasets:

Filtered images:
This dataset contains the images used to train and test the model. They come from a dataset available in Tensorflow, called standford dogs.
In this case, I used standford dogs, and Filtered the four breeds needed: golden retriever, german shepherd, french bulldog and poodle.

Pento-ssr-challenge:
This is the dataset provided by pento. I added one Image of a dobermann, to see if it classifies it correctly as "other".
